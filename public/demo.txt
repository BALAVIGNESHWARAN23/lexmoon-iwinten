Case: Web Application Penetration testing for SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

Petition: Project Report by Balavigneshwaran P

Facts:
- The target was the web application: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
- Tools used: XSSer, Wireshark, and SQLMap.
- Web Application Penetration Testing was conducted to identify SQL injection and Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Detailed exploration of types of SQL Injection (SQLi) and XSS.
- Identified and exploited vulnerabilities using the mentioned tools, and analyzed captured packets with Wireshark.
- SQLMap was employed to automatically identify SQL injection vulnerabilities, retrieving databases named acuart and information_schema.
- XSS vulnerabilities were tested using the XSSer tool, accessing its GUI via the `xsser –gtk` command.

Issues:
- Identifying the types of SQL injection (SQLi): In-band (Classic SQLi), Inferential (Blind SQLi), and Out-of-band SQLi.
- Testing and exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities using SQLMap, leading to the retrieval of sensitive databases.
- Identifying types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS.
- Conducting detailed XSS attacks, analyzing the results.
- Capturing and analyzing network packets during penetration testing with Wireshark.

Judgements:
- Detailed step-by-step SQL injection testing using SQLMap resulted in database retrieval despite multiple failed attempts.
- Successful execution of XSS attacks demonstrated vulnerabilities, evidenced by screenshots showing the outcomes of these attacks.

Judge’s Observations:
- The project effectively demonstrated identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.
- SQLMap, XSSer, and Wireshark proved to be effective tools in the penetration testing process.
- Packet analysis through Wireshark highlighted the sensitivity of transmitted data during the attack.

Final Judgement (Conclusion):
The Target Website http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php was subjected to SQL injection, resulting in the retrieval of sensitive databases. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack was successfully executed. The Wireshark tool was employed to capture and analyze network packets, substantiating the penetration testing efforts.
